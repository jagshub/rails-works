<h2>Welcome to the Product Hunt API 2.0</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this API is to provide access to Product Hunt data via a simple
  <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> interface.
</p>
<p>
  If you have any ideas for improvements or just wanna chat about queries or mutations<br>
  <a href="https://github.com/producthunt/producthunt-api/issues">let us know on GitHub.</a> Remember to add <strong>v2</strong> label to the issue.
</p>

<h3>Not familiar with GraphQL?</h3>
<p>
  Here are some resources that can help you get started with GraphQL.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> home page.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.howtographql.com/" target="_blank">How To GraphQL</a> - a free and open-source tutorial to learn all around GraphQL to go from zero to production.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Privileges</h3>
<p>There are 3 types of scopes that an application can request on behalf of the user:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Public :</strong> Access public information on Product Hunt.</li>
  <li><strong>Private :</strong> Access Product Hunt on behalf of the authenticated user. For e.g application will be able to read goals of the user.</li>
  <li><strong>Write :</strong> Take actions on Product Hunt on behalf of the user. For e.g application will be able to mark user's goals as complete/incomplete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if you are building an application in which you need to know if a user has followed a topic, or commented on a post, you would need to request <em>`public private`</em> scope.</p>
<ul>
  <li>By default <strong>all apps are read-only</strong> i.e they have <em>`public`</em> scope. </li>
  <li>
    As part of API 2.0 we have decided to give <strong>partial write access</strong> to third party applications depending on the use-case. If your application needs it
    feel free to get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:<%= CommunityContact::PH_EMAIL %>"><%= CommunityContact::PH_EMAIL %></a>. Remember you would also need to request <em>`public private write`</em> scope
    for write functions to work.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Product Hunt API must not be used for commercial purposes. If you would like to use it for
    your business, please contact us at <a href="mailto:<%= CommunityContact::PH_EMAIL %>"><%= CommunityContact::PH_EMAIL %></a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Accessing Endpoints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The API is reachable at <strong>https://api.producthunt.com/v2/api/graphql</strong></li>
  <li>Currently the API is only accessible with a provided <em>access_token</em>.</li>
  <li>We reserve the right to rate-limit any application if we feel you are not following <strong>fair-use</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you require faster access without rate limit please contact us.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Get started: Getting an OAuth2 token</h3>
<p>Get a token on behalf of a user:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the steps in <em>OAuth User Authentication</em> oauth#authorize to receive an access_grant</li>
  <li>Use the access_grant in oauth#token</li>
  <li>Add the <em>Authorization</em> http header with the token to all requests. E.g <em>Authorization: Bearer {token}</em></li>
  <li>Test this and troubleshoot according to the examples in oauth#test</li>
</ul>

<p>Get a token without user context. (eg before a user logs in)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Follow the steps explained in <em>OAuth Client Only Authentication</em> oauth#token</li>
  <li>Please remember that this tokens limit you to public endpoints that don't require user context.</li>
</ul>

<p>But… i just wanted to run a simple script?</p>
<ul>
  <li>The oauth2 flow is a bit of a overkill if you just want to run a few scripts</li>
  <li>
    We provide a developer_token (does not expire, linked to your account) in the
    <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/v2/oauth/applications">app dashboard</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Are there any other ways to do Product Hunt Integrations?</h3>
<p>
  Yes! There is quite a bunch of third party APIs. Blazin' fast fulltext search,
  SDKs with callbacks for real-time like interaction, web-hooks, etc etc.
  Go here for the <a href="https://github.com/producthunt/producthunt-api/wiki/Product-Hunt-APIs">full list</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Btw there is also a lot of Open Source software out there.
  <a href="https://github.com/producthunt/producthunt-api/wiki/Code-Examples">Take a look</a>.
  Maybe there is something you can reuse.
</p>
