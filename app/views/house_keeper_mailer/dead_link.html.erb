      Hey there!
    </p>

    <p>
      The links to <%= link_to @post.name, Routes.slug_post_url(@post) -%> seem
      not to be working anymore.
      <br />
      If you'd like to update them, it's simple, you can
      <%= link_to(
        'edit your product here',
        Routes.edit_post_submission_url(@post),
        ) -%>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here are the links marked as broken in our system:
      <ul>
        <% @post.links.broken.each do |link| -%>
          <li><%= link_to link.url, link.url -%></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    </p>


    <p class="text-center">
      <%= button_to(
        "Update links for #{ @post.name }",
        Routes.edit_post_submission_url(@post),
        ) -%>
    </p>

    <p>
      If <%= @post.name -%> was sunset, we can't wait to see what incredible
      product you'll build and launch next ðŸ˜º
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you,
      <br />
