    There‚Äôs not much to do at this point except rest on your laurels üçπ. <br/> Who are we kidding? You‚Äôve got an empire to build. <br/> <br/> 
    As a reminder, sharing this success with your community is a great idea. Product of the Month is a feat that few achieve üöÄ. Show off your awards to your users by embedding <%= @badges.length() == 1 ? "your badge" : "badges" %> on your site. Badges are easy to embed in your homepage or footer.
    <% @badges.each do |badge| %>
      <div class="preview-container">

    Your journey is looking bright and your Product Hub is looking great after all this community fanfare too (you could probably even teach us a thing or two, <%= link_to 'if you want to', help_center_article_url('2775217-how-to-pitch-to-the-blog') , target: '_blank', class: 'transactional-v2-link' %>). <br/><br/>
    While we anxiously await your next launch, we‚Äôll remind you that product discovery never sleeps at Product Hunt. So keep an eye on your Product Hub reviews, consider telling your <%= link_to 'Maker Story', maker_stories(), target: '_blank', class: 'transactional-v2-link' %>, and remember that your community is following along as you start to think about how you‚Äôll package your next launch.
