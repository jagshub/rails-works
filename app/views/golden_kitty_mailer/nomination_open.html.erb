  <p> Hey there,</p>

  <p> Great news! The Golden Kitty Awards are here! </p>

  <p> 
    If you’re new around here, The Golden Kitty Awards are an annual celebration of the year’s new products and the makers behind them! 
    They’re <span style="text-decoration: line-through">kind of</span> (actually) a really <span> <%= link_to 'big deal', 'https://twitter.com/sacca/status/805801971143753729', target: '_blank' %>.

    The Golden Kitty Awards are also our chance to highlight purrific and outstanding members of this community. 
    You don’t even have to be a maker to win — you just have to be an asset to the makers, thinkers, and product lovers in the community (we see you).

  <p>
    Golden Kitty winners are decided as a result of your nominations and votes across 25 product categories (leave the two human categories to us). If you have a product in mind that is worthy of the coveted Golden Kitty 😻,
